      'content': '**Post 1:**\n\nIn the past 12 months, my LinkedIn following went from 36k to 58k. But followers won\'t buy you a snickers bar. Here\'s the actual value of that brand growth for Apollo.io:\n\n- Generated nearly 30MM impressions\n- 37 inbound demo requests (direct DMs asking to learn more about Apollo 28 of which were qualified T1-T3 opportunities)\n- Spoke on 14 podcasts\n- Contributed to 3 sales blogs\n- Drove a bunch of free user signups\n\n\n^^^ This ALL happened passively just doing my job as a marketer. \n\nImagine if I had a quota and tried to strategically turn this into a funnel?\n\nWell, I used to as a BDR!\n\nOn Wednesday, James A. O\'Sullivan and I are breaking down how I leveraged my LinkedIn presence to intentionally build a 7-figure pipeline in under a year. \n\n\n\n\nNo gatekeeping. All my tips and tricks to help you get started- for FREE. üòé\n\nBe there or be square. (l*nk in comments)\n\n\nPs. A few folks who show up will win a profile audit from me so you should def register:)))\n\nPps. ‚ôªÔ∏è Repost to let a sales pal know this is happening!\n\n**Post 2:**\n\nPro-tip that booked me 4-5 meetings from my top accounts per quarter. Steal it: (Or don\'t... I do not care) üíÅüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI would hit up an executive peer and run a sequence thru them. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nExecs like to talk to other execs. They don\'t always want to reply to an SDR. \n\nI\'d run a little sequence partnering with my VP of Sales or CRO to connect with, Email + follow up DM my prospects. \n\nTHREE things you need! \n\n1. Copy for them to send from their LinkedIn + instructions on who/when to send those connections.\n\n2. An email alias as them within your own SEP (you can do this in Apollo.io if you need one)\n\n3. Your exec on board :) Do not impersonate them\n\n\nTHE PLAYBOOK\n\nHere is how I would run this sequence today if I was an SDR or AE at Apollo trying to book a meeting with 15Five:\n\n1. Draft a connection note to my top 5 contacts at 15Five from Leandra Fishman to connect. (Ask her to send out those connections)\n\n2. Create an email Alias as Leandra in my Apollo instance and write a 3 step sequence (2 emails+ 1 LinkedIn DM post connection acceptance)\n\n3. Run the sequence as Leandra - with her Bcc\'d on sends + replies (this is LOW volume but high-value accounts so it should not inundate your execs)\n\n4. When we get a reply collaborate with Leandra directly to schedule a call and have her facilitate the handoff to me, the rep. \n\n5. Keep Leandra CC\'d on the email thread as the deal progresses.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: This should ONLY be used to top accounts. This is NOT a method that works with high volume/spray and pray strategies. To keep it authentic keep your exec looped in. \n\nBonus- work gifting into your strategy:) Exec to exec gifting is neat:)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it!\n\nYou won\'t try it.....\n\n\n\n\n‚ôªÔ∏è Repost for a sales pal in need of some MASSIVE meetings this Q:)\n\n**Post 3:**\n\nMental health will always be a core pillar of my content. If that\'s not your thing, all good- feel free to scroll past those posts or unfollow. It\'s all love.\n\nBut if you think I need to "stop writing about it" because you\'re worried it will hurt my career?\n\nCheck your bias. \n\nMessages like this don\'t communicate to me that companies will judge me. They communicate that YOU are judging me and others like me for what is actually a widely experienced and woefully stigmatized struggle.\n\nWe are all just human beings, being human. There is room for that in the workplace. \n\n\n\n\nAnd to any brands, companies, leaders, and future employers who take pause knowing that I am someone who speaks about, advocates for, and struggles with- mental health... I will save you some time. \n\nWe are NOT a good fit. üíÅüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nAnd that is okay. :)\n\n\n\n\nPs. Please be kind in the comments. This person isn\'t evil, just misguided. We don\'t change perception by piling on hate. We change it with compassion and vulnerability. \n\nSo imma\' keep doing what I am doing. \n\nBack to your regularly scheduled SDR tips tomorrow <3',

You work for a company which offers the following value to their prospects:{{Value Proposition}} Take a deep breath, clear your mind and from the given posts first select the post most relevant to your value proposition. The entire post could be related to the value proposition or there could be a small portion in the post that might be relevant. \n\nAfter having found the most relevant post, write a **single sentence** opener for an outreach message referencing the post. Summarize the content of the post briefly to make a catchy opener. \n\nIf none of the posts are remotely relevant to the value proposition, say "no relevant post" instead of forcing an opener.\n\nAhdhere to the following guidelines to create an authentic, high quality opener:\n1. Active and dynamic; recipients absolutely despise passive and dull  \n2. Avoid salesy jargon. \n3. Avoid mentioning things that they obviously already know. Avoid being patronizing and condescending. Don\'t just reword their speech and quote it back to them. It is super annoying! \n4. Avoid using salesy words like "perfectly", "innovative", "possibly", "unique", "expert", or any word or phrases that make you sound overconfident.\n5. Remember that the value proposition we have is only a guess that it will benefit the recipient. We might be completely wrong. Thus, avoid being overly confident in the opener. Choose appropriate words to express this uncertainty.\n   5.1 One way to express this uncertainty is to start the opener confirming that your value proposition is indeed valid for them. Start the opener with "if", "is", "what", "did", etc.\n   2.2 The other way is to be transparent and express in the opener itself that you might be wrong\n\n**'},
